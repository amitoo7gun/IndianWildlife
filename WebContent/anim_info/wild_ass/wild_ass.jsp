    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
      <img src="wild_ass_indian-wild-ass_0000.jpg" alt="Indian Wild Ass" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The natural habitat of Asiatic wild ass comprises of saline desert,          grassland in arid zone and shrub land of India. Its geographical range          extends from western India, through Sind and Baluchistan, Afghanistan,          and southeastern Iran. Presently, the animal is mainly found in the          little Rann of Kutch and its surrounding areas (lying in the Greater          Rann of Kutch) in the Gujarat province. Indian wild ass also inhabits          Surendranagar, Banaskantha, Mehsana, and other Kutch districts.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
Male wild ass, known as stallion, is found either living alone or in a          small group of 2 to 3 members. However, family groups are quite common. <br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
Indian wild ass is usually seen grazing between the period of dawn and          dusk. It feeds mainly on grass, leaves and fruits of plant, crop,          Prosopis pods, and saline vegetation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
Mating in case of Indian wild ass usually takes place in the rainy          season. The stallions fight against each other for the possession of the          female. The age of maturity is 2 to 3 years. When the mating season of a          female wild ass, known as mare, approaches, she leaves the group and          goes with the stallion. They live together for a few days and then, come          back to join the group. The gestation period lasts for approximately          eleven months, after which a single calf is born. <br />
<br />
<strong>Status</strong><br />
The population of Indian wild ass is declining at a fast pace. One of          the reasons for this is that it became a victim of a disease known as          surra in 1958 and 1960, which resulted in the death of many animals. In          November and December of 1961, the outbreak of South African Horse          Sickness led to a further decline in the population. The other threats          include habitat destruction because of encroachment, excessive grazing,          etc.</div>
