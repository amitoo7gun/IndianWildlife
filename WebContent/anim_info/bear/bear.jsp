<div>Indian black bear is also known by the names of Asiatic Black
Bear (Ursus thibetanus), Tibetan black bear, Himalayan black bear and
Moon bear. They grow to a length of approximately 4 to 6 feet, right
from the nose to the tail. The small eyes of the bear, along with its
rounded ears, a long snout, a large body, a short tail, and shaggy hair,
differentiate it from the other types of bears. The small shoulder hump,
a furry rear instep, a concave facial contour, small and curved claws
and narrow ears further accentuate the difference. Last but not the
least, Asiatic black bear also has a whitish V-shaped breast patch, not
found in the other bear species of India. <br />
<br />
The male black bear weighs between 220 and 480 pounds, while the females
are110 to 275 pounds in weight. The senses of the Himalayan black bears
of India are greatly developed and they boast of almost twice the
hearing sensitivity possessed by humans. Black bears have colored vision
and their eyesight is very sharp. Even their olfactory senses (ability
to smell) are highly evolved. The mating season of the Himalayan black
bears is usually from late May to early July. They give birth to two
cubs at a time, which stay with the mother for almost seventeen months.<br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
<img src="bear_indian-black-bear_0000.jpg" alt="Indian Black Bear"
	align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Indian black bears are
omnivorous. Their diet depends upon the season as well as the
availability of food. The fall season is the time for having acorns,
chestnuts, walnuts, and other fatty food. In spring season, they survive
on a diet of bamboo, raspberry, hydrangea, and other plants, along with
rodent's caches of acorns. Summer season is perfect for having
raspberries, cherries, grasses and ants. Asiatic black bears are also
known to attack livestock at times.<br />
<br />
<strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
Asiatic black bear generally inhabits upper subtropical and lower moist
temperate zones. They are found in East Asia and South Asia, including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Burma,
southern Siberia, Russia, northeastern China, Taiwan and Japan. In
India, Asiatic black bears are found occupying Himalayan foothills, at a
height of less than 3,750 m. Black bears are also found in the Arun
valley of Nepal, inhabiting Sal-Castanopsis, Castanopsis and
Rhododendron forests as well as the forests with bamboo groves.<br />
<br />
<strong>Status and Threats</strong><br />
Asiatic black bear is listed as endangered on the World Conservation
Union's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Animals. One of the major
reasons that have contributed to the declining population of black bears
is rampant deforestation and habitat loss. Asiatic black bears also face
threat from farmers, who kill them in order to protect their livestock.
