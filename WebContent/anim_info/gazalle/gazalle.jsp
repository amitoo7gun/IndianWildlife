      <div>Indian          Gazelle, also known as Chinkara, is a species of gazelle found in South          Asia. It belongs to the Bovidae family and is scientifically known as          Gazella bennettii. The life expectancy of a Chinkara is between 12 to 15          years, less than that of many other deer species. Male gazelles are          believed to be territorial in nature and are not prone to wandering for          large distances. Gazelles come across as very nervous animals and always          seem to be on alert. It is believed that the dwindling population of          Chinkaras is leading to a decline in the population of Cheetah, their          main predators, in India. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        Standing at a height of 65 cm, Indian gazelle comes across as smaller          than many other species of deer. Its coat is covered with smooth and          glossy fur, which is reddish-brown in color. The belly of the gazelles          is white and they weigh around 23-25 kg. There are dark chestnut stripes          on the sides of the face that stretch on from the corner of the eye to          the muzzle. The muzzle is also bordered by white stripes. Chinkara also          has horns, which have an average length of 30 cm. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="gazalle_indian-gazelle.jpg" alt="Indian Gazelle" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Chinkara is a very shy animal and tries to stay as far from human          settlement as possible. It is mainly seen roaming alone in the wild.          However, at times, one can see Indian gazelles in small groups,          comprising of upto 4 animals. One of the unique characteristics of the          Indian gazelle is that it can survive without water for days at a          stretch. The need for fluids is met through plants and dewdrops.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        The natural habitat of the gazelle comprises of the grasslands and          desert areas of India, Iran and Pakistan.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Indian gazelles depend on vegetation as their diet and prefer grass and          fruits. During winter season, females and sub-adults take a diet that is          rich in protein and has less of tannins. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        There is no fixed breeding season for the gazelles of India. However,          they usually mate somewhere around autumn and spring. The gestation          period lasts for five and a half months.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Indian gazelle has been classified as a highly vulnerable species and          founds a mention in the endangered species list. The main reason for          their declining population is the fact that the animals are hunted for          game.<br />
