        <div><strong>Best          Time for a Elephant Safari :</strong> November to March <br />
          <br />
          A majority of the wildlife tourists coming to the Indian subcontinent          choose to go on an elephant safari. Such a safari enables them to visit          even those terrains, which are beyond the reach of jeeps or bikes.          Taking an elephant safari in India will enable you to have a taste of          the royal bygone era of the country, when riding on the magnificent          animal was a privilege of only the kings. The traditional howdah          (palanquin) has now been replaced with modest facilities. However, the          elephant safaris in India still retain their charm and splendor. <br />
  <br />
          The pace of the elephant provides you the perfect opportunity of          noticing even the minutest of details. At the same time, the height          enables you to have the perfect view of the entire setting. Elephant          safari in India is mainly used for exploring the wildlife sanctuaries of          the country. Riding on top of an elephant, you can go quite close to the          wild animals, while free from the danger of watching them in the open.          Almost all the wildlife sanctuaries of India provide the option of          visiting the wild animals from the back of an elephant.<br />

A          number of attendants are required for the elephants and even the safari          camps are pretty lavish. Therefore, the safari tends to be quite          expensive and is recommended only in case of large groups. You need to          keep certain things in mind while going on an elephant safari in India.          The weather conditions tend to vary a lot, so it is advisable to carry          portable water with you, along with sunscreen, goggles, and a first aid          kit. Wear comfortable as well as airy clothes, which are not too          revealing. <br />
