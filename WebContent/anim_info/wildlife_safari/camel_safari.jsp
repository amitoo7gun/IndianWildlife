        <div><strong>Best          Time for a Camel Safari :</strong> October/November to March<br />
          <br />
          Anyone coming to the Indian subcontinent on an adventure holiday must          make a stoppage at Rajasthan to go on a camel safari. It is one of the          best ways to explore the magnificent desert and can take you on routes          ranging from short, easy ones to long, rigorous ones. Camel safaris in          India mainly revolve around the cities of Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and          Bikaner. The erstwhile kingdoms of Maharajas, these cities boast of the          regal charm even today. The other cities that may be covered on an          Indian camel safari tour include Shekhawati, Pushkar and Nagaur.<br />
  <br />
          Throughout the safari, the camel will be your constant companion,          taking you through the burning sand in the day and the bone-chilling          milieu in the night. Booking a camel safari in India is the perfect way          to explore the rich architectural heritage of the royal state of          Rajasthan. The safari lets you explore the entire Thar Desert and serves          as a window to the rich culture, heritage and life styles of the          Rajasthani people. The day is consumed by visits to the various          monuments, like forts, places, havelis, etc. While, the night is spent          either in camps or in the numerous heritage hotels in which the state          abounds. <br />

A typical Indian camel safari will bring you across the architectural          ruins of Lodurva and Sam sand dunes, along with the water source of          Moolsagar. Another popular route for camel safari in India is through          the Shekhawati region, passing through towns of Ramgarh, Nawalgarh,          Dundlod, Mandawa and Churu. However, these safaris last for around 11          days. You can also take one-day or two-days camel safari, covering only          the major destinations. The period of October to March is for special          camel safaris to Pushkar and Nagaur.<br />
