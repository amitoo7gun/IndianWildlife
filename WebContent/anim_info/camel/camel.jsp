    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Also          known as :</strong> Ship of the Desert<br />
      <strong>Type :</strong> Single-humped<br />
      <strong>Water retaining capacity :</strong> Five liters<br />
      <br />
The camels found in India are the single-humped camels, also known as          the Dromedary camels. Long-curved neck, deep-narrow chest and a single          hump characterize the Indian camel. The hump is used by the camels as          reservoir of fatty tissues. In times of scarcity, the tissues are          metabolized and the camel receives energy. The size of the hump is not          the same in all the camels. It differs from one camel to another,          depending upon its nutritional state. In times of starvation, the hump          can get reduced to almost a non-existent size. <br />
<br />
Indian dromedary camels have a heavy growth of hair on throat,          shoulder, and hump, which is longer than the rest of the body. On an          average, the camels in India live for a period of 40 to 50 years. They          are widely used by the people of Rajasthan as a means of transportation.          Infact, the camels are known as the 'Ship of the Desert'. They are used          for carrying goods as well as people. Indian camels also provide humans          with milk, meat, wool, leather and fuel (from their dried dung).<br />
<br />
<strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
<img src="Untitled-1_indian-camel_0001.jpg" alt="Indian Camel" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> One can mainly find camels in the desert, dry arid regions of the          country, especially the state of Rajasthan. <br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
Camels primarily survive on an herbivorous diet, consisting of thorny          plants and dry grasses. </div>
    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Behavior</strong><br />
Dromedary camels can be usually seen in groups, consisting of anywhere          between two to twenty members. In every group, there is one male member          who dominates the rest of the members, which comprise of females,          sub-adults and young ones. While moving in a group, one can see the          dominant male directing the group from the rear, while the female          members lead at the front. <br />
<br />
<strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
Indian camels attain maturity at the age of 4 to 5 years. They give          birth to one offspring at a time and the gestation period is around          fifteen months. The young ones are raised by their mother for a period          of two years after their birth, after which they attain adulthood. <br />
<br />
Camels have the ability to endure wide changes in their body          temperature as well as water content. Their body temperature may vary as          widely as being 41 deg C (106 deg F) in the daytime and being 34 deg C          (93 deg F) at night. Only when they cross this limit do they begin to          sweat, thus helping them save upto five liters of water in one day.          Indian camels can cope up with as much as twenty-five percent weight          loss, caused by sweating. The thick coat of a camel reflects sunlight          and serves as insulation from the heat of the sand.</div>

      <div> Since times immemorial, camels have been widely used          in the Indian state of Rajasthan, for the purpose of carrying goods as          well as people. They belong to the Camelidae family and are          scientifically known as Camelus dromedarius. On an average, the lifespan          of a camel is around 40 to 50 years and they are herbivorous. Dromedary          Camels attain the age of maturity at four to five years. In the          following lines, we have provided some more interesting facts about the          camel.
