        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        The coat of golden langurs is covered with rich golden to bright          creamish hair. The face is black and they have a very long tail, which          may measure upto 50 cm in length. The long tail of the golden langur          helps it in balancing itself while leaping across the branches of trees.          It is mainly found inhabiting the forests of India that have high trees. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet </strong><br />
        Golden langur is herbivorous and its diet mainly consists of ripe and          unripe fruits, mature and young leaves, seeds, buds and flowers. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        One can see Golden langurs mainly in groups, which may range from those          consisting of only 8 members to the ones with 50 members. In each group,          one male langur attaches itself with a number of females. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Golden langurs are currently considered to be an endangered species in          India. Presently, their population is around 10,000 only. One of the          major reasons for the dwindling population is the destruction as well as          degradation of their natural habitat by humans. <br />

      <div>Hanuman          Langur is believed to be one of the Old World monkeys, belonging to the          Semnopithecus Genus. They comprise of 15 subspecies and are terrestrial          in nature. Earlier hanuman langurs were believed to comprise of a single          species. However, now they are recognized as seven distinct species.          Hanuman langur is also known by the name of Gray Langur, Entellus Langur          and Common Indian Langur. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        The fur of the gray langur of India may be gray, dark brown or even          golden in color. The face is black and the size varies from one          subspecies to another. Male langurs grow to a length of 51 cm to 78 cm          and weigh about 18 kg. The female langurs are smaller, with a length of          40 cm to 68 cm and weight of about 11 kg. The length of the tail is          between 69 cm and 101 cm.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Connection with Indian Mythology</strong><br />
        Gray langur of India is believed to have derived its other name,          Hanuman Langur, from the Hindu Monkey-god, Hanuman. It is said that the          langurs helped Lord Hanuman in the battle of Lanka. It was during this          time that the monkey god got trapped in the fire. This episode resulted          in the black face of the langurs, since they got burnt while helping the          Lord. Hindus regard the Entellus Langurs of India as sacred and do not          assault them at all. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
  <img src="langur_indian-hanuman-langur.jpg" alt="Indian Hanuman Langur" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Common Indian langurs survive on a diet comprising of leaves, fruit,          buds and flowers. The exact diet, however, changes from season to          season. During winters, they survive on a diet of mature leaves. In          summer season, they mainly survive on fruits. Insects, tree bark and gum          also supplement their diet. Hanuman langurs can easily digest seeds with          high levels of the toxins and can eat even soil and stones.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Hanuman langurs are found inhabiting tropical, dry thorn scrub, pine          and alpine forest as well as urban areas of the Indian subcontinent.          They spent a major portion of their time on the ground, with the          exception of their sleeping time. Presently, common langurs are found in          India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Burma.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        Gray langur of India can usually be found living in large groups,          dominated by a male langur. The membership of the group may be anywhere          between 11 and 60. However, they hold the dominating position for a very          short period only, which may stretch upto 18 months. Whenever a new male          takes over the group, all the infants of the previous alpha male are          killed. Entellus Langurs of India may form bachelor groups also. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        Female langurs attain maturity at 3 to 4 years of age, while males          achieve the same in 4 to 5 years. However, they start mating in the 6th          or 7th year only. The gestation period is 190 to 210 days, after which a          single infant is born. Only in very rare cases does a female langur give          birth to two infants. Where there are a number of males in a group, only          the high-ranking males can mate with any female. The other males get a          chance to mate only if they manage to sneak by the high-ranking males.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Common Indian langur is listed in the lower risk category by the IUCN<br />
