      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">Deccan          plateau is situated to the south of the Indo-Gangetic plain and          stretches over an area of approximately 14,21,000 sq km. Over 43 percent          of India's landmass comprises of the plateau, which spreads over to          eight states. Covered by ancient forests, which are older than the          Himalayas, the plateau is home to a rich wildlife, which includes          animals like Elephants, Tiger, Gaur and Buffalo, along with a wide          variety of birds. The dense forests of the Deccan plateau are fed by a          number of rivers, namely Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, Indravati and          Godavari.<br />
        <br />
There are as many as 27 areas in the Deccan region that have been          earmarked as protected areas for the Indian wildlife. The habitats of          these areas are basically of three types, those comprising of deciduous          forests, thorn forests and scrublands. Infact, Deccan peninsula has some          of the largest tracts of deciduous forests in the country. Along with          these areas, there are also pockets of semi-evergreen and evergreen          forests, which are found mainly in the mountain range known as the          Eastern Ghats.<br />
