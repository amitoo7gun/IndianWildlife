      <div>Wild          boar is considered to be the wild antecedent of the domestic pig of the          Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Suidae biological family, which          also includes the Warthog and Bushpig of Africa, the Pygmy Hog of          northern India and the Babirusa of Indonesia. Indian wild boars are also          quite closely related to peccary or javelina of North, Central and South          America.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        The thick coat of the wild boar of India is grayish-black in color and          is covered with bristle-like hair. It can grow upto a length of 6 feet          and may weigh as much as 440 lb (200 kg). The features of a wild boar          are quite similar to that of a pig. It has a prominent ridge of hair,          which match the spine. The tail is short and straight and the snout is          quite narrow. <br />
  <br />
        The most noticeable as well as most distinguishing feature of the wild          boars comprise of a pair of extended canines. These canines grow both          upward as well as outward. Indian wild boars possess an acute sense of          smell. Even their eyesight and hearing power is fairly strong. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="wild_boar_indian-wild-boar.jpg" alt="Indian Wild Boar" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Wild boars can be found roaming around in groups, known as sounders.          The number of sows, in a characteristic sounder, is two or three and          rest of the members are the young ones. A typical sounder comprises of          20 animals on an average. In exceptional cases, the membership of a          sounder may go upto 50 also. Adult males join a sounder only during the          mating period and for the rest of the year they prefer to stay alone.          Indian wild boars are basically nocturnal creatures, which forage from          dusk to dawn. When surprised or attacked, they may get aggressive. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Wild boars eat anything and everything, including nuts, berries,          carrion, roots, tubers, refuse, insects, small reptiles, etc. Young deer          and lambs may also form a part of their diet. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Habitat</strong><br />
        Wild boar is found inhabiting the woodlands of Central Europe,          Mediterranean Region (including North Africa's Atlas Mountains) and most          of Asia (including India). <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        There is no fixed mating period of the wild boars of India. However,          whenever it takes place, it results in a formal contest between the          males to decide the dominant male. The winner gets to mate with the          female boar. The maturity period is one year and gestation period lasts          for four months. A female wild boar usually gives birth in the spring          season and the litter normally consists of 4 to 6 cubs. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        The population of Indian wild boars is declining at a fast pace. The          reasons for this are large scale poaching as well as habitat          destruction. At some point of time, Indian sub-continent consisted of          6-7 species of wild boar. However, today only one of them is left. <br />

      <div> Wild boar is quite similar to the domestic pig of the          Indian subcontinent. It is grayish-black in color and is scientifically          known as Sus scrofa. Large scale poaching, along with the loss of          habitat, has resulted in reduction in the number of species of the wild          boar in India to one from 6-7. On an average, they live for 8 to 10          years and give birth to 4-6 cubs. As the article moves further, you will          come across more interesting facts about the wild boar of India.
