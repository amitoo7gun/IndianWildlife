    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">Bengal          tiger is a subspecies of tiger, which is found in the Bengal region of          the Indian subcontinent. One of the most common tiger subspecies, it is          also found in a number of other Asian countries, like Bangladesh, Nepal,          Bhutan, Myanmar, Tibet, etc. Usually Royal Bengal Tigers of India are          reddish-brown to rust-brown in color with black stripes all over.          However, a mutation may result in their color being white also. Such a          tiger is known as the White tiger. Bengal tiger is the national animal          of both the Indian subcontinent as well as Bangladesh. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
Bengal tiger has a coat of reddish-brown to rust-brown color, with          black stripes and a white underbelly. The head and body of a male tiger          measures 6 to 9 feet in length. Its tail may grow as long as 3 feet. An          average Royal Bengal tiger has a weight of somewhere between 400 and 660          pounds (180 and 300 kg), though some tigers have been found to weigh          more than 300 kg also. Its shoulder height may measure upto 3 feet (0.97          m). The maximum length of the skull may be around 10 to 15 inches (250          to 380 mm). <br />
<br />
<img src="tiger_indian-bengal-tiger.jpg" alt="Indian Bengal Tiger" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> A female Bengal tiger may grow to a length of 5 to 6 feet in length          (only head and body). Its tail is may be around 2 to 3 feet long.          Standing at a shoulder height of around 2.5 feet, female Bengal tigers          may weigh around 250 to 450 pounds (110 to 200 kg). Their maximum skull          length may be about 8 to 12 inches length. The largest Bengal tiger seen          till date weighed close to 390 kg.<br />
<br />
<strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
The natural habitat of Royal Bengal tigers comprises of Indian          grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests, scrub forests, wet and          dry deciduous forests and mangroves. The animal is found inhabiting the          Asian countries of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Tibet.          In India, Bengal tigers are found mainly in the Bengal region. <br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
Bengal tigers of India survive on a purely carnivorous diet. Their prey          primarily comprises of medium and large-sized animals, like wild boar,          deer, gaurs, water buffalo, young Asian Elephants and rhino calves. They          may also stalk small animals, namely hares, monkeys, langurs and          peacocks. At times, Bengal tigers may hunt other predators like          leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles and dholes. They can eat          upto about 40 kg (84 lb) of meat at a time and then go without eating          for days at a stretch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Behavior</strong><br />
Bengal tiger is mainly a solitary creature, which forms alliances only          during the mating period. It is a nocturnal creature, which prefers to          hunt at night. Bengal tigers are extremely good tree climbers and are          also quite apt at swimming. Infact, they swim quite frequently to ambush          their prey, which are drinking or swimming or trying to escape. <br />
<br />
<strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
Mating usually takes place either during winter season or during spring          season. The mating period lasts for 20 to 30 days, during which one can          hear loud and distinct communication calls. The cub stays with the          mother and siblings till two years of age, after which it goes off to          wander on its own. <br />
<br />
<strong>Status</strong><br />
The population of Bengal tigers, throughout the world, is estimated to          be approximately 4,500. Of this, a major proportion (around 3000 tigers)          lives in the Indian subcontinent. Early 1990s saw the population of          tigers in India declining at a fast pace, because of large-scale          poaching as well as habitat loss. Tiger Conservation Program, known as          Project Tiger, was started in India to improve the status of tigers.          However, it success is open to question till date. <br />
<br />
<strong>Threats</strong> <br />
The major threats to the Bengal tiger comprise of poaching and habitat          destruction. They are hunted for their teeth, nails and skin and even          killed for their other parts used in East Asian medicines. Urbanization          and revenge killing has also contributed to the deteriorating population          of the animal. <br />
<br />
<strong>White Tigers</strong><br />
White tiger of India is not a separate subspecies of tiger. Rather, it          is an individual specimen of the ordinary tiger, with a different          mutation. In tigers, a genetic condition may cause paler coloration,          resulting in the birth of a tiger that is white in color. Most of the          cases of white tigers have been seen in the Bengal tigers. However, once          can find such mutation in the captive Siberian tigers as well as several          other subspecies. White tigers have white-to-crème colored fur.          Their noses are pink and the stripes on their body are gray or          chocolate-brown in color. The eyes may be blue, green or amber.</div>
    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
      <div> Breeding programs for the Bengal tiger of India were          started from the year 1880 only. The tigers were bred for the first time          at the Alipore Zoo of Calcutta (now Kolkata). Since the breeding program          for Indian Bengal tigers turned out to be very successful, more programs          were carried out. The last two decades have seen many more programs          receiving success. International Tiger Studbook of 1994 revealed the          global captive population of the Bengal tigers to be somewhere around          333.<br />
        <br />
        The quality of breeding programs is getting very much affected these          days. The reason for this is that the Indian Bengal tigers are being          mixed with other subspecies of tigers brought by dealers from outside          India. The lineage of such captive tigers becomes highly questionable          and they become inappropriate for conservation purposes. The entire          captive population of Bengal tiger has been kept in the Indian zoos          only, except for one female Bengal tiger that is presently in North          America.<br />
  <br />
        Many zoological parks in India are also carrying out breeding programs          revolving around the Bengal Tiger of India under carefully controlled          conditions. Not a very long time back, a lion cub was born in the          Calcutta (Kolkata) zoo. However, the newborn cubs are genetically quite          different from the older tigers. This is because of a feature of their          genetic recombination, which is known as genetic variation. This genetic          variation helps the cubs in adapting to the nature as well as fighting          against any odds. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
      <div> Project Tiger was launched by the Indian Government          in 1973-74. The aim of the project was to control as well as supplement          the dwindling population of the Royal Bengal tigers in the country.          Under the Project Tiger of India, specially constituted tiger reserves          are being set up, which are sought to be replicas of the various          bio-geographical regions of the country. The core areas of the reserves          are made free of any human settlement, while the buffer areas are          dedicated to 'conservation oriented' land use. <br />
        <br />
        The objective behind the establishment of the Project Tiger is to          conserve the entire eco-system in which tigers live. With the          introduction of the subsequent 'Five Year Plans', the core and buffer          zones in some of the tiger reserves is being enlarged. A number of other          steps are also being taken, including intensification of protection and          eco-development in the buffer zones, creation of additional tiger          reserves and strengthening of the research activities.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Principles of Project Tiger</strong><br />
        Each and every tiger reserve of India has been and is presently being          developed as per the following principles:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>All types of human exploitation and biotic disturbance taking              place in the core area of the reserve will be eliminated.</li>
        <li>The activities in the buffer area will be regulated.</li>
        <li>Habitat management will be limited to only those damages that              have been inflicted by humans and other interferences. </li>
        <li>The changes taking place in flora and fauna will be monitored on              a regular basis. </li>
        <li>Continuous research will carried on in relation to wildlife.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>Initially, nine tiger reserves were set up under the          'Project Tiger', namely </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Bandipur National Park (1973-74) - Karnataka</li>
        <li>Jim Corbett National Park (1973-74) - Uttar Pradesh</li>
        <li>Kanha National Park (1973-74) - Madhya Pradesh</li>
        <li>Manas National Park (1973-74) - Assam</li>
        <li>Melghat Wildlife Sanctuary (1973-74) - Maharashtra</li>
        <li>Palamau National Park (1973-74) - Bihar</li>
        <li>Ranthambore National Park (1973-74) - Rajasthan</li>
        <li>Simlipal National Park (1973-74) - West Bengal</li>
        <li>Sunderbans National Park (1973-74) - Orissa</li>
      </ul>
      <div>Today the number of tiger reserves, which come under          the 'Project tiger' of India, has increased to 27. In the following          lines, we are providing a list of the remaining 18 tiger reserves in          India, along with the extensions that were done later:</div>

        <li>Bhadra National Park (1998-99) - Karnataka</li>
        <li>Pench National Park (1998-99) - Maharashtra</li>

        <li>Nagarhole National Park Extension (1999-2000) - Karnataka</li>
      </ul>
      <div><strong>Financial Aspect</strong><br />
        Project Tiger of India was initially started as fully central          government sponsored scheme. However, since 1980-81, the expenditure is          being equally shared by the central government as well as the state          government. World Wild Federation has also given an aid of US $ 1          million for the project, in the form of equipments, expertise and          literature.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Achievements</strong><br />
        The adoption of Project Tiger has resulted in recovery of the          deteriorated habitat and consequently, an increase in the population of          tigers. From 268 in 9 reserves (1972), the population of tigers has          increased to 1576 in 27 reserves (2003). At the same time, the          population of other wild animals in the tiger reserves has also          increased. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Management of Project Tiger</strong><br />
        The implementation of the project is in the hands of the respective          State Governments. A committee, known as the 'Steering Committee', is          responsible for the administration of the project. Each reserve has a          'Field Director', who has a team of field and technical personnel. Field          execution is the responsibility of the 'Chief Wildlife Warden', at the          state level, and of the 'Director',</div>

      <div> Bengal tiger is mainly found in the Asian countries,          comprising of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Tibet. It          belongs to the Felidae Family and is the national animal of both the          Indian subcontinent and Bangladesh. A mutation in the genes of a Bengal          tiger may result in the birth of a slightly different tiger, which we          know as the White tiger of India. A male Bengal tiger may be 6 feet to 9          feet in length (head and body), while a female grows to a length of 5 to          6 feet only. In the following lines we have tried to present a number of          fast as well as interesting facts about the Indian Bengal tiger. Check          out information on the White tiger of India:</div>

      <div> The sight of the beautiful and magnificent orange and          black animal rustling amongst bushes is enough to give anyone goose          bumps. The grace and splendor of a tiger is beyond the scope of words.          Whether the animal is peeping over a rock or chasing a prey, one          experiences an instantaneous impulse to capture the entire scenario with          a camera. The brunt of scorching sun blazing over the head is forgotten          the moment the Royal Bengal tiger comes within the scope of your          eyesight. <br />
        <br />
        What better place to witness the magnificent beauty of this animal,          than the numerous tiger reserves of India. The amazing wildlife as well          as the varied flora of the Indian tiger reserves will make you instantly          fall in love with them. Since every tiger reserve in India is at a          significant distance from the other, it is not possible to cover all of          them in a single visit.
