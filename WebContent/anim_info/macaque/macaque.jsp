  <strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/macaque/assam-macaque.html">Bonnet Macaque</a></strong><br />
        Bonnet Macaque, an Old World monkey, is also known by the scientific          name of Macaca radiata. Found only in India, it has been named so          because of its physical appearance. Indian Bonnet macaques have a          cap-like whorl of hair on their head, which radiates outward from the          center. Since the coil of hair resembles a hat, they have been named as          Bonnet macaques.<br />

      <div><img src="macaque_arunachal-macaque.jpg" alt="Arunachal Macaque" align="right" height="155" width="205" />Arunachal          Macaque, scientifically known as Macaca munzala, is a native primate of          Arunachal Pradesh state of northeastern India. It is called by the local          population as Munzala, meaning monkey of the deep forest. Arunachal          Macaques were discovered by the Indian scientists in the year 2004 only.          Biologists from the Nature Conservation Foundation were the ones to          discover it during an expedition to the high altitude regions of          Arunachal Pradesh.<br />
        <br />
        Infact, the first primate found after the discovery of Indonesian Pagai          Island Macaque in 1903, is the Arunachal Macaque of India only. It is a          large macaque, with a brown coat and a short tail. The face is very dark          and the body is compactly built. Arunachal Macaque bears close          resemblance to the Assam Macaque and the Tibetan Macaque. It is usually          found inhabiting areas situated at an altitude of 2000 m to 3500 m. <br />
  <br />
        The orange-buff crown patch of the Arunachal Macaque of India, adorned          with a dark wedge, differentiates it from the other macaque species.          Then, there is the prominent ruff and the prognathous skull that add to          the distinction. Last but not the least, the primate also has dense          white fur on the underside. <br />

        The entire length of the Lion-tailed macaque is somewhere between 45          and 60 cm. The tail is of a medium size and reaches a length of          approximately 25 cm. At the end of the tail is a black tuft, resembling          the tail of a lion. A male Lion-tailed macaque is slightly bigger than          the female (5 kg) and weighs around 7 kg. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="macaque_lion-tailed-macaque.jpg" alt="Lion Tailed Macaque" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Lion-tailed macaque is a diurnal creature and is quite good at climbing          trees. It prefers to stay away from humans, unlike the other macaques.          Lion-tailed macaques are sociable creatures and are seen mostly in          groups. The group is a hierarchical one, consisting of ten to twenty          members (both male and female). The leader of the group is a male          macaque and the young males leave the group the moment they attain          maturity. Lion-tailed macaques are territorial in nature and defend the          area they believe to be theirs. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        The diet of a Lion-tailed macaque comprises of indigenous fruits,          leaves, buds, insects, small vertebrates and invertebrates. In case of          shortage, they can turn to fruits, seeds, shoots, pith, flower, cone,          mesocarp and other parts of many non-indigenous plants. In Indian zoos,          they are given a diet of fruits, vegetables, sunflower seeds, granary          bread, peanuts, maize and special primate dietary supplement pellets.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        Lion-tailed macaque of India reaches the age of maturity 2.5 to 4 years          after birth, depending upon its sex. Its mating period extends to the          whole of the year. The gestation period is six months, after which a          single young one is born. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status and Threats</strong><br />
        Lion-tailed macaques are one of the most rare as well as threatened          primates. Presently, their population is estimated to be somewhere          around 2,500. The greatest threat faced by Lion-tailed macaques is the          deterioration of their natural habitat. Since they stay away from human          settlements, this deterioration has led to a sharp decline in their          number. At the same time, they are widely hunted for their meat and fur.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        The natural habitat of the Lion-tailed macaque comprises of tropical          dry forest and tropical rainforests of India. <br />

      <div>Long-tailed          macaque is also known by some other names, like the Crab-eating Macaque          or the Cynomolgus Monkey. It is an arboreal macaque, belonging to the          Macaca genus, and has the scientific name of Macaca fascicularis. A          native of the Southeast Asia, the Crab-eating macaque of India has also          been flown into outer space. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        An adult Long-tailed macaque grows to length of approximately 38-55 cm.          However, the arms and legs are comparatively quite short. The tail,          which is longer than the body, grows to a length of 40-65 cm. Females          are shorter than males (5-9 kg), weighing about 3-6 kg. A newborn          macaque weighs only 350 g and has black fur. As it grows older, the fur          turns to yellow-green, gray-green, or reddish-brown color.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Connection with Science</strong><br />
        Crab-eating macaques have been used to a large extent by researchers in          their medical experiments. The primate is a carrier of B-virus          (Herpesvirus simiae). At the same time, it is believed to be a possible          vector for monkey pox also. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="macaque_indian-long-tailed-macaque.jpg" alt="Indian Long Tailed Macaque" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Long-tailed macaque is a social animal, which is usually found in          groups of anywhere between five and sixty members. On an average, the          number of female members in a group is twice or thrice the number of          males. The group size depends on the level of predation and availability          of food. The males keep on moving in and out of the group, but female          members remain attached to the same group throughout their life. The          high-ranking males of a group are generally more successful at          reproduction. At the same time, the high-ranking females are usually          better at raising surviving offspring.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The gestation period of Indian Crab-eating macaque is 167 to 193 days          and the number of offspring born is one. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        The natural habitat of Indian Cynomolgus monkeys is not very          restricted. It extends to primary lowland rainforests, secondary          rainforests, riverine and coastal forests of nipa palm and mangrove of          India. They can easily adjust with humans and will not encounter          problems while settling around a human inhabitation also. Long-tailed          macaques are found primarily in Malay Archipelago islands of Sumatra,          Java and Borneo, the islands of the Philippines, and the Nicobar Islands          of India. The species was also introduced in Anggaur Island of Palau,          western New Guinea, Mauritius and Hong Kong. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Crab-eating macaque of India eats a wide variety of animals, plants,          and other materials. Approximately 60 to 90 percent of its diet          comprises of fruits and seeds and the rest includes leaves, flowers,          roots and bark. The macaque also devours vertebrates, invertebrates and          bird eggs.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Threat to Biodiversity</strong><br />
        Long-tailed macaque can become a threat to the biodiversity of the          areas where it is non-native. However, the same does not apply to the          native habitat of the primate.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status </strong><br />
        Cynomolgus Monkeys are ranked as the third largest of all the primate          species, after humans and Rhesus macaques. IUCN Red List has categorized          them in the 'Lower Risk' category and CITES has listed them in the          Appendix II<br />

      <div>A          typical macaque, the Rhesus monkey of India is believed to be one of the          best species of the Old World monkeys. It is an excellent swimmer and          enjoys water. Rhesus macaques are quite comfortable around humans and          have the tendency to move from rural to urban areas in search of easy          food. The average lifespan of Rhesus macaques is approximately 15 years          in the wild. In captivity, a female rhesus macaque may survive for 20 to          25 years, while a male may survive only for 15 to 20 years.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        A male Rhesus macaque grows, on an average, to a length of 50 to 55 cm          and weighs around 7 to 8 kg. The female, on the other hand, is a little          shorter, with length of 45 to 55 cm and weight of 5 to 6 kg. The tail is          of medium length, bordering somewhere between 20.7 and 22.9 cm. The coat          of Indian Rhesus macaques is brown or gray in color. Their face is pink          in color and is devoid of hair. There cheeks of the macaque are          pouch-like, where it can store its food temporarily. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Connection with Science</strong><br />
  <img src="macaque_indian-rhesus-macaque.jpg" alt="Indian Rhesus Macaque" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Rhesus macaques are widely made use of in medical and biological          research. One of the major reasons for this is that they can be easily          raised in captivity. Some of the experiments where Rhesus Macaques were          used include experiments on maternal deprivation carried out in the          1950s. During 1950s and 1960s, they were launched into space by NASA.          Rhesus macaque is also the first cloned primate in the world. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Rhesus monkey of India is mainly herbivorous and survives on a diet of          leaves, pine needles, roots and occasionally insects or small animals. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Rhesus macaques are found inhabiting arid, open areas like Indian          grasslands, woodlands and mountainous regions, which are upto 2,500 m in          altitude. Their population is distributed throughout Afghanistan,          northern India and southern China.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior </strong><br />
        Rhesus monkeys of India are companionable creatures and tend to form          groups easily. Usually, a group comprises of both males as well as          females. Though, on an average, a group or troop comprises of 20          members, it may go upto 180 members in extreme cases. The social          hierarchy is matriarchal and the number of females is generally more          than the males. The responsibility of the young ones, along with          territory surveillance, is shared by all the members of the troop.          Rhesus macaques are quite vocal by nature and are both arboreal and          terrestrial. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        There is no particular mating period of Rhesus macaques, it may occur          at any time of the year. The gestation period is between 135 and 194          days. The age of maturity in case of female Rhesus macaques is three          years and in case of males, it is four years. Rhesus macaques are          sexually dimorphic. <br />
