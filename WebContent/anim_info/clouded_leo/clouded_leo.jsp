    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">Clouded          leopards belong to the Neofelis genus and have the scientific name of          Neofelis nebulosa. The average lifespan of a clouded leopard is 11 years          in the wild. However, in cases of captivity, it may go upto 17 years. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
A clouded leopard grows to a length of 60 to 110 cm (2 ft to 3 ft 6          in). Its weigh may be somewhere between 11 and 23 kg (25 lbs and 50          lbs). The coat of Indian leopards is tan in color and has large,          erratically shaped, dark-edged ellipses marks on it. Since the shape of          the ellipses resembles clouds, the animals have been given the name of          'Clouded Leopards'. Their build is huge and their canine teeth are the          longest amongst all the cat species. <br />
<br />
The short flexible legs of the Clouded leopard of India, along with its          large paws and sharp claws, make it an excellent tree climber. Its tail          is almost as long as its entire body, which serves as a further support          in climbing. The cubs of clouded leopard do not have dark ellipse,          rather their entire body is dark in color. <br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
<img src="clouded_leo_indian-clouded-leopard_0000.jpg" alt="Indian Clouded Leopard" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The clouded leopard is a carnivore and mainly survives on arboreal and          terrestrial mammals, primarily consisting of gibbons, macaques and          proboscis monkey. Its other prey includes small mammals, deer, birds,          porcupines, and domestic livestock.<br />
<br />
<strong>No Relation to Leopard</strong><br />
Clouded leopard has no close relation to leopard and comes under a          separate genus, known as Neofelis. <br />
<br />
<strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
Clouded leopards prefer to stay in tropical and subtropical forest of          India, with an altitude of over 2,000 meters. One can also find the          animal inhabiting Indian mangrove swamps and grassland. Their natural          habitat stretches through southern China, the eastern Himalayas,          northeast India, and Southeast Asia. It is believed that the species has          become extinct in Taiwan. <br />
    </div><div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
      <div><strong>Sub-species</strong><br />
        Earlier, the clouded leopard was believed to have four subspecies,          namely:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Neofelis nebulosa brachyurus - Taiwan (believed to be extinct in              the wild) </li>
        <li>Neofelis nebulosa diardi - Borneo, Sumatra and Java (absent since              Neolithic times) </li>
        <li>Neofelis nebulosa macrosceloides - Nepal to Myanmar</li>
        <li>Neofelis nebulosa nebulosa - Southern China to eastern Myanmar </li>
      </ul>
      <div>However, a few years back, molecular genetic analyses          have put a strong case for inclusion of two more species in this          category, namely Neofelis nebulosa (found in mainland Asia) and Neofelis          diardi (found in Indonesian archipelago).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        There is hardly any information about the behavioral traits of the          Clouded leopard in the wild. However, it is believed that they are          solitary creatures, which can be seldom seen in groups. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        Female Clouded leopard attains maturity after it reaches the age of two          years. After the gestation period, which lasts for about 85 to 93 days,          it gives birth to cubs, which may be 1 to 5 in number. The cubs get          active within 5 weeks of birth and become independent after around 10          months.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Clouded leopard has been listed in the Appendix I by CITES, the          Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna          and Flora. It is an endangered species and its international trade for          any reason, except for scientific research, is restricted. Clouded          leopard also finds a mention in the Endangered Species Act of the United          States.</div>

      <div> The main conservation efforts taken in context of the          clouded leopards in the Indian subcontinent relate to the captive          breeding program. Irrespective of the fact that during the initial          stages of the program the success rate was quite low, the efforts in          this regard were continued. One of the reasons that led to the failure          was that the female leopards faced a lot of aggression from the males.          Since the period of courtship is largely ignored in the wild, its           existence in captivity proved to be a negative factor. <br />
        <br />
        Experience provided the conductors with a solution to this problem.          Before the breeding program begins, the pair of clouded leopards is          carefully chosen so that they have no problem in adjusting with each          other. Thereafter, they are provided with enough opportunities to bond          with each other and breed successfully. However, throughout the period,          the meeting opportunities are carefully regulated so as to prevent both          of the leopards from getting harmed. The other essential requirements of          successful conservation efforts for leopards in India include a proper          environment. <br />
  <br />
        The enclosures where they are kept are properly designed to resemble          their natural habitat as much as possible. Efforts are made to provide          the leopards with adequate space, climbing facilities, etc. Even their          diet is properly taken care of. Apart from the breeding program, efforts          are also being made to stop the rapid decline in the population of the          wild cats. A ban has been imposed on their hunting. In countries like          Thailand, clouded leopards have been radio collared and their          territorial movements are being constantly monitored.</div>
