      <div>Indian          leopard is one of the 8-9 valid leopard subspecies found throughout the          world. Known by the scientific name of Panthera pardus, it is the fourth          largest of the four 'big cats' of the Panthera genus. At the same time,          leopards are also the fifth largest of all cat species. The name          'Leopard' has been derived from a combination of two Greek and Latin          words leo and pard, 'leo' meaning lion and 'pard' meaning panther. This          name was given to the animal since it was initially believed to be          crossbreed of a lion and a panther. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        As far as the length of the Indian leopard is concerned, it may be          anywhere between one meters and two meters. Their average weight hovers          somewhere around 30 kg and 70 kg (65 lbs to 155 lbs). Leopards have a          heavy and sturdy body and their head is larger in proportion to their          body. The coat of a leopard is covered with rosettes and they can climb          trees with effortless ease. The cubs of a leopard have longer and          thicker fur than the adults and even their pelage is grayer. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior </strong><br />
  <img src="leopard_indian-leopard.jpg" alt="Indian Leopard" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Indian leopards are nocturnal creatures and are considered to be one of          the most surreptitious animals. They can easily make themselves          undetected, even while living proximate to human settlements. Leopards          are very good swimmers, but lead a solitary life. Occasionally, one can          find them roaming in a group of 3 to 4 animals. They have an acute sense          of hearing, along with sharp eyesight. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Leopards are carnivores and eat almost every animal, ranging from          monkeys to reptiles to fish. Infact, it is believed that they hunt from          amongst 90 species of animals. Injured, sickly or struggling leopards,          with a shortage of prey, may even hunt humans. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The mating season of leopards depends upon the areas they inhabit. For          example, the leopards of India mate throughout the year while those in          Siberia mate from January to February. Their estrous cycle lasts about          46 days and the female usually remains in heat for 6-7 days. They give          birth to 2-3 cubs at a time, out of which 1 or 2 survive in most of the          cases. Three months after being born, the cubs start joining their          mother in hunts and live with her for the next 18 to 24 months.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Till some centuries back, leopards used to roam around in almost all          parts of Africa and southern Asia. However, today, their habitat has          been reduced to Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia Minor, the Middle East, India,          Pakistan, China, Siberia, much of mainland South-East Asia and the          islands of Java and Sri Lanka.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Current Status and Threats</strong><br />
        The worldwide population of leopards is considered to be around 50,000.          Nevertheless, the population of the 'Big Cat' has been decreasing at          quite a rapid pace in all the countries, including India. The major          reasons for this are their large-scale poaching as well as destruction          of their natural habitat by humans. The subspecies that have been          declared as endangered are Amur, Anatolian, Barbary, North Chinese and          South Arabian Leopards.<br />
  <br />
