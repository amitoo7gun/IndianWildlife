  <img src="redpanda_indian-red-panda.jpg" alt="Indian Red Panda" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Red fox grows to a length of 50 to 60 cm. Its tail is very long;          measuring somewhere around 30 to 60 cm. Male pandas are larger than the          females. The weight of a male panda is between 4.5 kg and 6.2 kg, while          that of a female is between 3.7 kg and 4.5 kg. The upper part of their          body is covered with long and soft, reddish-brown fur. On the lower          parts of the body, the fur is black in color. The face is covered with          tear markings and the tail is ringed and very bushy. The short and black          legs of a red panda are covered with thick soles, which serve as an          insulation from snow. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        Common pandas of India are basically nocturnal creatures, which are          found resting in tree branches and hollows during the day. They are          solitary creatures and you will seldom find them roaming around in          groups. Except for some twittering and whistling sounds, Red pandas          hardly communicate with each other. In case of any threat, they either          hurry into an inaccessible rock column or a tree or attack with their          razor-sharp claws. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Red panda is usually found in mountainous regions of India, at an          altitude of more than 1800 m. They are very sensitive to heat and cannot          tolerate temperatures over 25 deg C. Red Pandas are native to          southeastern Asia, Himalayan Mountains in Nepal, southern Tibet, China,          Bhutan, northeast India, highlands of Myanmar, Gongshan Mountains of          Yunnan China and Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan China.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet </strong><br />
        The diet of Indian red fox bear mainly (2/3rd) consists of bamboo. The          reason for this is that a panda cannot digest cellulose. The other          constituents of its diet include berries, fruit, mushrooms, roots,          acorns, lichen, grasses, young birds, eggs, small rodents and insects.          When they are in captivity, red pandas willingly eat meat also. The diet          of a red panda contains a very small amount of calories and because of          this reason; the animal rarely does anything other than sleeping and          eating. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        Red pandas of India attain maturity only at the age of 2 to 3 years.          Their mating period stretches on from the end of December to the middle          of February. The gestation period lasts for 112 to 158 days, after which          the female gives birth to, between one and four, young ones. Usually the          young ones are born during the period starting at the end of May and          lasting upto the beginning of July. Even the timing of birth of all the          young ones is more or less the same, between 4:00 pm and 9:00 am. The          nest of an Indian red panda bear is generally located in a hollow tree          or a rock column. Only five months after their birth do the young ones          become totally independent. As the next mating season approaches, the          mothers abandon their babies.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Indian Red panda bear is under great threat of extinction. The main          reason for the declining population is the disintegration of its natural          habitats, along with its specific diet needs. At the same time, Indian          red fox animal is also hunted in large numbers for its highly valued fur          and tail. In 1996, the IUCN declared the Common pandas as threatened          species. However, now they have been put in the list of endangered          species. The exact population of the Common panda is not known, but it          is estimated to be less than 2500. <br />
