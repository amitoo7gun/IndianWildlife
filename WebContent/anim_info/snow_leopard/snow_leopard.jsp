      <div>Snow          leopard is a native animal of mountain ranges of central and southern          Asia, including India. It is also known as Ounce and has a scientific          name of &quot;Panthera uncia&quot;. Snow leopards can live for a maximum          of 18 years in then wild. In captivity, their lifespan increases to 20          years. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Debate </strong><br />
        There is some disagreement regarding the genus to which the snow          leopard belongs. Some taxonomists believe that it belongs to the genus          Panthera, while others believe that it has own genus, Uncia. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>No Connection with Leopard</strong> <br />
        Despite the common misconception, the snow leopard has no relation with          the leopard. Infact, some people believe that it has a close connection          with cheetah. Both of them show similar physical traits to quite an          extent and both are incapable of roaring.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Physical traits</strong><br />
  <img src="snow_leopard_indian-snow-leopard.jpg" alt="Indian Snow Leopard" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The coat of a snow leopard of India is gray in color and is covered          with ringed spots and rosettes of black or brown. The tail is striped          and the fur is soft as well as beautiful. The tail as well as the bottom          part of the paws of snow leopards is covered with fur. Snow leopards may          weigh upto 75 kg and the length of their head and body may reach 59          inches. Their tail is also quite long and measures between 31 and 39          inches. The head of a male snow leopard is much squarer and wider than          that of the female.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        During summer season, snow leopards prefer to stay either above the          tree line on mountainous meadows or in the rocky regions of the Indian          subcontinent, which are upto 6000 m in height. Winter season is the time          for them to come down to an altitude of somewhere around 2000 m. The          home range of a snow leopard varies to quite an extent. For example, in          Nepal, they need only 30-65 sq km to survive, while, in Mongolia, their          range increase to 1,000 sq km. In central and south Asia, they are found          in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic,          Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        We mostly find snow leopards leading isolated lives and rarely forming          any groups. Usually, they kill animals, which are thrice as big as they          are. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating behavior</strong><br />
        The mating season of the snow leopard extends from January to May and          the gestation period is usually of 98 to 103 days.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Snow leopards are carnivores and have a diet consisting of ibex,          bharal, markhor, urial, boars, marmots and other small rodents.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Snow leopards have been listed under CITES, Appendix I, Endangered          Species Act. Their total population (throughout the world) ranges          between 3,500 and 7,000 in the wild and 600 to 700 being in the various          zoos of the world. <br />
  <br />
