        <div>Blue          peacock is regarded as one of the most beautiful birds throughout the          world. It is also the National Bird of the Indian subcontinent. Peacock          is the name given to a male peafowl, while the female is known as          Peahen.

          <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
          One of the most unique as well as distinctive features of the Blue          peacocks is their beautiful train, comprising of tail feathers. The          train is 1.4-1.6 m long, measuring more than 60 percent of the body          length. It comprises of 100-150 highly specialized upper tail coverts.          Whenever a peacock wants to attract a peahen, it erects the train into a          fabulous fan. The entire body length of the Indian peacocks averages          around 2.3 m and the wingspan is around 1.4-1.6 m long. Their weight          hovers around 4.0 to 6.0 kg.<br />

The sole embellishment adorning the peahen is its          prominent crest and the green neck feathers. Peahens are shorter than          peacocks and measure not more than 1 m in length. Their weight is          somewhere between 2.75 and 4.0 kg. The peacock as well as the peahen has          a white patch under the eyes. <br />
