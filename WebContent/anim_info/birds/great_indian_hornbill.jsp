  <br />
  <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
          Great Indian Hornbill is a large bird, which grows to a height of          around 100 to 120 cm. It wingspan measures somewhere around 150 cm and          the tail feathers are 36 inches in length. The Great Hornbills of India          have an average weight of 6.5 pounds.

  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
  <img src="images/crested_serpent_eagle_great-indian-hornbill_0000.jpg" alt="Great Indian Hornbill " align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The diet of the Great Pied Hornbill of India consists primarily of          fruits. However, the bird supplements this with small mammals, birds,          lizards, snakes and insects.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
          The Great Pied Hornbills of India are known to form monogamous pair          bonds. They are mostly seen in groups of 2-40 individuals. Great Indian          hornbill forms a pair for many years and in some cases, for the entire          lifetime. The female hornbill lays 1-2 eggs at a time.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Unique Nesting Ritual</strong><br />
          At the time of nesting, the female hornbill starts living in a tree          hollow sealed with dung and pellets of mud. The male collects the          pellets, swallows them and regurgitates small saliva-cased building          materials. This material is given to the female, along with food,          through a slit in the tree seal. The process of incubation continues for          6-8 weeks. The female hornbill comes out only after she has molted and          fresh feathers have grown on her and her young ones. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
          The population of Great Pied Hornbill of India is declining over the          years. The reason for this is habitat loss, along with hunting of the          bird for food and for its casques. Great Indian Hornbill has also been          listed in Appendix I of CITES and also as 'Lower Risk/Near Threatened'          by USFWS.<br />
