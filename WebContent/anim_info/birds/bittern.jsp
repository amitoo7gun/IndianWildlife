        <div>Yellow          bittern of India is one of the smallest members of the bittern species.          It is found occupying the Asian countries of India, Sri Lanka, Japan and          Indonesia. Yellow bitterns are scientifically known as Lxobrychus          sinensis and are of Old World origins. They are shy by nature and are          brilliant in the camouflage technique. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
          Yellow bitterns of India are small birds, growing to an average length          of 38 cm. The neck is short, but the bill is quite long. The male Yellow          bittern is of dull yellow color on the upper side as well as the buff          below. The head and neck are of chestnut color and the crown is black.          The female Yellow bittern has streaked-brown crown, neck and breast. The          chicks are pale peachish-pink in color and can climb even before they          can fly.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="images/work_indian-yellow-bittern.jpg" alt="Indian Yellow Bittern" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Yellow bitterns are also solitary creatures, which usually hunt on          their own. They use their long sturdy bills to capture the prey. Yellow          bitterns of India can slip rather easily and are also pretty good at          quietly climbing among the bottom of reed beds and undergrowth. Usually,          they hunt from cover. However, at times, one can also see them foraging          over floating vegetation, like water-hyacinth beds. The birds are more          active during dawn and dusk.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
          Yellow bitterns prefer to breed in dense vegetation near water.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
          Yellow Bitterns feed on insects, fish and amphibians.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
          Yellow bitterns inhabit Indian freshwater wetlands, which are covered          with thick vegetation. This includes marshes, grasslands, reed beds,          ponds, dredge-mine lagoons and reservoirs, including man-made canals.          One can also spot them in mangroves. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
          Yellow Bittern is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of          1918.</div>
