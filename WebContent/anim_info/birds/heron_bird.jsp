        <div>Indian          heron belongs is a member of the large wading bird family, known as          Ardeidae. It is found mostly inhabiting the tropical and sub tropical          areas. However, heron birds of India can also be seen in temperate          areas. There is one major characteristic that distinguishes herons from          the other birds. Unlike other birds, when they fly, their necks get          folded back on their shoulders. <br />
          <br />
          Most of the time, the herons of India come across as a solitary          creature, hunting and feeding alone. Nevertheless, they can be found          roosting and nesting in large colonies, known as heronries. In the          following lines, we have provided information on the various subspecies          of the Heron bird, found in India:<br />

It is very strongly related to the American          Great Blue Heron as well as Australian White-faced Heron. Infact, many          people misunderstand the Australian White-faced Heron as the Grey Heron.          More.<br />

  <strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-birds/heron/pond-heron.html">Pond Heron</a></strong><br />
          Pond herons are one of the most commonly found species of the Indian          subcontinent. Docile by nature, they can be seen in their natural          habitat as well as on the outskirts of villages. The first description          related to the Pond heron bird was given in the year 1832, by Colonel W.          H. Sykes.

        <div>Night          heron belongs to the Nycticorax and Gorsachius genera. It is a medium          sized bird, which is mainly found in the tropical regions of the Indian          subcontinent. The name 'Night Heron' is derived on the basis of the fact          that these birds prefer to catch their prey during night. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
          Night herons have a body coat of either white or gray color. The only          exceptions to this are their crown and back, which are pretty dark in          color. Adult Night herons have short necks and short legs. The young          ones have a coat that is brown in color and is dotted with white and          gray. Infact, the young night herons look quite similar to Nycticorax          species.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
          Night heron bird of India nests in colonies, built upon platforms of          sticks. The nests are situated mostly in a group of trees. In case of          protected locations such as islands or reed beds, night herons may build          nests on the ground. During daytime, they are seen resting in trees or          in bushes. Night herons usually lay 3 to 8 eggs at a time. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
  <img src="images/work_indian-night-heron.jpg" alt="Indian Night Heron" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The diet of a night heron bird comprises of small fish, crustaceans,          frogs, aquatic insects and small mammals.

  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
          Presently, Indian subcontinent has only seven subspecies of the night          heron, which are existent. A number of other subspecies of the bird have          gone extinct because of its capability to colonize small, predator-free          oceanic islands and a tendency to evolve towards flightlessness.<br />

          One of the smaller subspecies of the heron bird, Pond heron of India          has a buff-brown back. It has a small neck and even the bill is tiny and          thick. As the summer season approaches, the feathers on the neck of          adult herons start growing and become long. The wings of the Pond herons          are white in color. This is the reason that when they gain flight, they          look totally white. The bird is quite similar in appearance to the          Squacco Heron.<br />

          The breeding habitat of the Pond herons consists of mainly marshy          wetlands in warm countries. They nest in small colonies, mostly with          other wading birds. The number of eggs laid falls between three and          five. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
          Pond herons feed on a diet of insects, fish and amphibians. One usually          finds the bird standing all hunched up at a far corner of a water body.          It watches and waits patiently till the time the prey comes within          reach. The moment this happens, the prey is pulled out in a flash.<br />
