    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">The          name 'Deer' is given to the ruminant mammals belonging to the family          Cervidae. They are one of the most beautiful creatures on this earth and          extend to approximately 34 species. Male deer, in India as well as the          world, are known as stags, harts, bucks or bulls, depending upon the          species to which they belong. While, the females are known as hinds,          does or cows. One can find deers widely distributed throughout the          world, including the Indian subcontinent. The only continents where deer          are not found are those of Antarctica and Australia.<br />
      <br />
The 34 species of deer can be divided broadly into two categories,          known as the old world group and the new world group. The former          comprises of the subfamilies Muntiacinae and Cervinae, while the latter          includes the subfamilies Hydropotinae and Odocoileinae. Read on to get          more information about the Indian deer.<br />

<strong>Axis Deer</strong></a><br />
<img src="deer_indian-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Axis Deer, also known as Chital Deer or Spotted Deer, is the native          animal of the Indian subcontinent. It is found very commonly in India          and is one of the most beautiful animals in the country. The spotted          deer of India was introduced in the state of Texas in the 1930s. Since          that time, axis deer of India has become the most widespread of the          entire deer species.<br />
<a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/brow-antlered-deer.html"><br />
<strong>Brow-antlered Deer</strong></a><br />
Brow-antlered deer are known by the scientific name of Cervus eldii.          They have a number of other names also, like Eld's Deer, Sangai Deer,          Thamin Deer and even Dancing Deer. The maximum lifespan of the Thamin          deer of India is only ten years and the deer has three subspecies also. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/hog-deer.html">Hog Deer</a></strong><br />
Hog Deer is a subspecies of deer, found in the areas stretching from          Pakistan, through northern India, to mainland Southeast Asia. A          population of the hog deer was introduced in a number of countries,          including Australia, the United States and Sri Lanka. <br />
<a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/muntjac-deer.html"><br />
<strong>Muntjac Deer</strong></a><br />
Muntjac Deer fall in the category of those deer that are shy and          elusive. They are also known by the name of Kakad deer or the Barking          deer in India. The reason for this name is their alarm call, which seems          very much similar to the barking of a dog. Indian Muntjac deer counts          amongst the ten subspecies of the Barking deer in the world. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/musk-deer.html">Musk Deer</a></strong><br />
Musk deer comprise of one of the most endangered deer species, not only          in the Indian subcontinent, but also in the whole world. They are          classified as a subfamily of the Cervidae and have four sub-species. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/sambar-deer.html">Sambar Deer</a></strong><br />
Sambar Deer are dark brown in color and attain a height of 102 cm to          160 cm (40 to 63 inches). The weight of the sambar deer of India may          touch 300 kg. There are chestnut marks on the rump as well as the          underparts. Sambhur deer of India also have beautiful manes. However,          they are not spotted by birth. The spots develop gradually after birth. <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.iloveindia.com/wildlife/indian-wild-animals/deer/swamp-deer.html">Swamp Deer</a></strong><br />
Swamp Deer, also known as Barasingha, is one of the most vulnerable          species of deer of the Indian subcontinent as well as the world.          Presently, one can find them only in the protected sanctuaries of India.          Known by the scientific name of Cervus duvauceli, the swamp deep of          India derives its name, Barasingha, from its large antlers.</div>
    <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
      <div>Axis          Deer, also known as Chital Deer or Spotted Deer, is the native animal of          the Indian subcontinent. It is found very commonly in India and is one          of the most beautiful animals in the country. The spotted deer of India          was introduced in the state of Texas in the 1930s. Since that time, it          has become the most widespread of the entire deer species. Chital deer          are found mostly in large family units, where a doe remains with her          mother even after becoming a mother herself. Spotted deer can be seen          roaming around either in mixed groups or separate bachelor groups. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        The spotted deer of India has a beautiful golden brown coat, which is          covered with big white spots. On an average, a male deer (known as stag)          grows to a shoulder height of somewhere between 85cm and 90cm. The          weight of a stag averages around 80 kg. Does are shorter as well as          lighter. The coat of an adult deer has brighter spots as compared to          that of fawns. At the same time, the white throat patch of a stag is          more prominent than that of a doe. <br />
  <br />
        The antlers of the axis deer of India branch to six points and sweep          back into an upward curve. They shed their antlers on an annual basis.          Mostly, the antlers of Indian chital deer grow to a length of 20 inches.          Only some deer have antlers that reach 30 inches. An Indian spotted          deer, whose anglers were 41 inches long, still holds the record for          having the longest antlers in the world. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
  <img src="deer_indian-axis-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Axis Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The natural habitat of the Chital Deer comprises of Indian parkland          habitats, with open woodland in grassy areas. They prefer to live near          rivers and other sources of water. In rare cases, they may inhabit thick          forests. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        Axis deer is a very introverted as well as reticent animal. Gregarious          by nature, it is found living in small herds comprising of 20 to 30          animals. In rare cases, the number of animals in a herd may go upto 100.          A few dominant individuals dominate the group, leaving the others to          will feed and rest. As male chital deer start growing older, they become          more and more isolated. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The mating behavior of the axis deer is quite different from the other          deer. They do not follow any seasonal rut and fawning can occur in any          month. Infact, one can find them in hard horn and in velvet at the same          time, that to during any time of the year. Spotted deer is also not seen          wallowing during rut. Rather, it emits a shrill call, proudly displaying          its beautiful antlers. The gestation period is 220 days, after which a          single young one is born. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Chital deer have still not faced too much threat and are far away from          the risk of extinction. However, they are being hunted at a rapid pace          and are even losing their habitat to humans, who are using it for          agricultural as well as residential purposes. If this continues          unabated, there is a possibility that the population of Indian spotted          deer may become threatened in the future. <br />

      <div>Brow-antlered          deer are known by the scientific name of Cervus eldii. They have a          number of other names also, like Eld's Deer, Sangai Deer, Thamin Deer          and even Dancing Deer. The maximum lifespan of the Thamin deer of India          is only ten years and the deer has three subspecies also. These include          the following:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Manipur Brow-antlered Deer or Sangai (C. e. eldii) - found in the              Manipur </li>
        <li>Burmese Brow-antlered Deer (C. e. thamin) - found in Myanmar</li>
        <li>Thailand Brow-antlered Deer (C. e. siamensis) - found in Thailand              and China</li>
      </ul>
      <div><strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        Sangai deer of India are medium in size and are very much like the          Barasingha in appearance. Long thin legs, a long body and a large head          on a thin neck further define their looks. The coat of the Eld's deer of          India changes in color from season to season. In summers, it          reddish-brown in color while in winters, it turns into dark brown. The          texture is coarse and rough, especially around the throat, where the          growth is quite long. There is a difference between the male and female          Thamin deer. Male deer have a darker color and a shorter tail. <br />
  <br />
  <img src="deer_indian-brow-antlered-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Brow Antlered Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The most remarkable feature of male Dancing deer comprises of their          antlers. They are usually multi-tined and can grow as long as 2 meters.          The average number of tines is 12. However, in exceptional cases, it can          go upto 20. The antlers of the male Brow-antlered deer have lyre shape          and they tend to grow backwards in a long arc. The brow tine is          exceptionally long and noticeable, one of the reasons for the deer to be          named as the Brow-antlered Deer. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status and Threats</strong><br />
        The population of Sangai deer of India has been continuously deceasing          over the past years. It is believed that the population of the Manipur          Brow-antlered deer is somewhere around 200 only. One can find about 2000          to 3000 Burmese Thamin deer in various locations of Myanmar. Though the          number of Thailand Eld's deer is not known exactly, it is believed to be          quite low. One of the main reasons for the diminishing population of the          Sangai deer of India is too much hunting. The destruction of their          habitat further has further worsened the situation. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Dancing Deer prefer to stay in open Indian parkland areas or light          woodland, which are near to rivers or wet marshy land. One can hardly          find them in thick forest or woodland. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Thamin deer are herbivorous and survive on a variety of water plants,          grasses, herbaceous plants, and shoots.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The mating season of the Eld's deer of India begins in February and          comes to an end in May. The control over a group of female deer is          established through a competition between the males. The gestation          period lies between 220 and 240 days, after which the female gives birth          to, usually, a single calf. Indian Sangai deer are spotted by birth.          However, as the calf grows, the spots fade away. The age of maturity is          around 18 months. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        Indian brow-antlered deer have been known to move in separate sex          herds, which may become as large as comprising of upto 50 members. When          the mating period approaches, stags join the female groups. <br />

      <div>Hog          Deer is a subspecies of deer, found in the areas stretching from          Pakistan, through northern India, to mainland Southeast Asia. A          population of the Hog deer was introduced in a number of countries,          including Australia, United States and Sri Lanka. The hog deer of India          has been named after the manner in which it runs. While running, its          head is hung low, which helps it in ducking the obstacles in the way,          rather than leaping over them. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        Hog deer is a small animal, which reaches a shoulder height of          approximately 60 cm. Counted amongst the smallest deer of the world, it          weighs somewhere between 20 to 30 kg. A male hog deer has beautiful          antlers, with a 3 points formation. Shed in spring season, these antlers          can grow to an average length of 30 cm. While running, the tail of a hog          deer gets erect, revealing the white underside.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="deer_indian-hog-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Hog Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Hog deer of India are mainly solitary creatures and turn into sociable          creatures only when the situation seems to be favorable. Whenever they          get startled, they whistle or bark as warning signal. Hog deer have          their own home ranges, which widely vary in size. A male hog deer is          aggressive and may form territorial boundaries, even at low population          density. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong> <br />
        Mating period of Indian Hog deer falls during the months of autumn,          usually September. The gestation period is of 8 months. When the mating          period approaches, male deer gather in the open and indulge in          antagonistic encounters. At a particular point of time, a male fights          over a single female only. Hog deer do not give mating calls like other          deer.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Hog deer has still not been listed as an endangered species. It may          live upto an age of 20 - 30 years, if not hunted by its natural          predators. <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        The diet of a Hog deer comprises primarily of grass.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Grasslands across the plains and low foothills of northern of form the          natural habitat of the Hog deer. They can also be seen in the alluvial          grass plains of the Indian subcontinent.<br />
  <br />

      <div>Muntjac          deer fall in the category of those deer that are shy and elusive. They          are also known by the name of Kakad deer or the Barking deer in India.          The reason for the latter name is their alarm call, which seems very          much similar to the barking of a dog. Indian Muntjac deer counts amongst          the ten subspecies of the Barking deer in the world. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits </strong><br />
        The height of the barking deer of India is somewhere between 50 cm to          75 cm. Their average lifespan is 20 to 30 years and they weigh somewhere          around 20 to 30 kg. They can be easily distinguished from the other          deer. The deer have two raised dark ridges on their forehead, which          extend till their antlers. One of the unique features of Kakad deer is          that they have both, a pair of antlers as well as overgrown canines          (tushes). They make use of the tushes mainly as weapons in a fight. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
  <img src="deer_indian-muntjac-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Muntjac Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Kakad deer are very shy creatures and prefer to live in isolation. One          rarely finds them moving around in groups. Even if you find them in          company, it will not be more than that of a single deer. The alarm call          of a Muntjac deer is taken seriously only when it is repeated endlessly. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        The low height and small stature of Indian Muntjac deer make grass and          fallen fruits the perfect food for them. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong> <br />
        The Barking deer are mostly seen inhabiting dense forests of India.          Even while grazing, they will rarely move into open grasslands and          usually remain near the edge of dense forests. However, one can          frequently find the Muntjac deer of India at salt licks. Apart from the          Kalesar forest of Haryana, they are found in almost all the dense          jungles of the Indian subcontinent.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status</strong><br />
        Barking deer is still not counted amongst the endangered species.          Nevertheless, the government has imposed a ban on their hunting. <br />
  <br />

      <div>Musk          deer comprise of one of the most endangered deer species, not only in          the Indian subcontinent, but also in the whole world. They are          classified as a subfamily of the Cervidae and have four sub-species,          namely:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Moschus chrysogaster (Himalayan Musk Deer)</li>
        <li>Moschus moschiferus (Siberian Musk Deer)</li>
        <li>Moschus berezovskii (Dwarf Musk Deer)</li>
        <li>Moschus fuscus (Black Musk Deer)</li>
      </ul>
      <div><strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
        Musk deer of India resemble medium-high dogs in size. They weigh just          about 9 to 11 kg and are very different from the other types of Indian          deer. The hind legs are quite muscular as well as long and the forelimbs          are short, weak and thin. The small and arched back make the musk deer          higher at the sacrum than at the shoulders. This also helps them in          taking well-coordinated jumps from their hind legs. The musk deer, both          make as well as female, do not have antlers.<br />
  <br />
  <img src="deer_indian-musk-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Musk Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> The canines of the males stick out downward from the mouth and are          larger than those of the females. The coat of newborn musk deer is dark          brown in color and is covered with short, soft hair. They also have          yellowish or white spots on their coat. As the second winter of a young          one approaches, it gets covered with a winter coat, with coarse hair and          less defined or absent spots. Male musk deer have a musk pouch, which is          situated between their sex organs and navel. Whenever they want to          attract a mate, they release a scent from this pouch. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior</strong><br />
        Indian musk deer tend to be very secretive. They can be found either          living alone or in groups, consisting of not more than three members.          Each group generally comprises of a mother and her young ones. One can          see them in the early morning, late evening or at night. During          snowfall, they become lethargic, climb trees and eat tree shrubs and          moss to survive. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        The most preferred habitat of the musk deer in India comprises of          pockets with rock outcrops, which serve as a shelter from their          predators. As winter season approaches, musk deer move to steep slopes,          full of coniferous trees. In summers, they like to stay in valleys with          forest rivers or around streams or near fields with good grassy          vegetation. Marshy forests do not count amongst the favorite habitat of          the musk deer. Their geographical range covers forested, mountainous          parts of Asia and parts of Eastern Russia.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet:</strong><br />
        Musk deer are herbivores and are known to consume over 130 species of          plants. They also consume a few mosses and lichens. In winter season,          Musk deer eat mainly arboreal lichens and some terrestrial bushy          lichens. Other consumption items include young shoots, coniferous          needles, leaves, buds, bark of mountain ash, aspens, maple, willow, bird          cherry, and honeysuckle. In summers, herbaceous plants, including          buckwheat, geranium, some grasses, and spirea, form a major portion of          their diet. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The mating season of Musk deer of India is in December and lasts for a          period of 3 to 4 weeks. The gestation period is somewhere between 185          and 195 days. The number of offspring is mostly one and seldom reaches          two. Secluded places are chosen for fawning and the young one stays with          the mother for upto two years (two winters).<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Status and Threats</strong><br />
        Musk deer is the most endangered of all the species of deer. One of the          main reasons for this is that they are highly poached for their musk.          The main predators of the Musk deer include lynx, wolverine, and the          yellow-throated marten.<br />

      <div>Sambar          Deer are dark brown in color and attain a height of 102 cm to 160 cm (40          to 63 inches). The weight of the sambar deer of India may touch 300 kg.          There are chestnut marks on the rump as well as the underparts. Sambur          deer of India also have beautiful manes. However, they are not spotted          by birth. The spots develop gradually after birth. Sambhur deer have          huge antlers, which may grow to a length of upto 100 cm (40 inches). The          antlers are rugged and have simple brow tines, along with forked beams          at the tip. These antlers are dropped by the deer on an annual basis. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Behavior</strong> <br />
        Indian sambar deer typically display solitary and isolated behavior.          Most of the time, they are seen roaming alone. In case they have          company, it is that of a very small group. The senses of sambar deer are          highly developed, which helps them in detecting their predators easily.          Whenever they perceive danger, they start giving a repetitive honking          alarm call. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
  <img src="deer_indian-sambar-deer.jpg" alt="Indian Sambar Deer" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Sambar deer are found inhabiting mainly damp woodland environments of          the Indian subcontinent, like marshes and swamps. One can hardly find          them residing far from water, but they can be found at high elevations          also. The other natural habitat of the Sambar deer comprises of Indian          temperate forests. Apart from India, Sambhur deer is found in the slopes          of the Himalayan Mountains, Burma, Thailand, Indochina, the Malay          Peninsula, southern China, Taiwan and the islands of Sumatra and Borneo          in Indonesia.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Sambur deer of India are herbivores and survive on a diet consisting of          coarse vegetation, grass, and herbs. Their staple diet includes grass,          sprigs, fruits and bamboo buds.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        The mating period of the Indian sambhur deer falls in the month of          November/December. The male deer guard their rutting territories and try          to attract the female deer through vocal and olfactory displays. The          gestation period of sambar deer is approximately 6 months and, usually,          they give birth to a single offspring only. <br />
