            <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Asiatic Lion</div>
            <div class="AccordionPanelContent">Asiatic          Lions once used to roam around the area, stretching from northern          Greece, across Southwest Asia, to central India. However, today, the          natural habitat of the majestic animal has been reduced to the Gir          forests of India only, making the Asiatic Lion almost synonymous with          the Indian Lion. Known scientifically as Panthera Leo persica, the royal          animal is depicted on the National Emblem of India, since it represents          power, strength and sovereignty. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Physical Traits</strong><br />
Asiatic Lion is the second largest 'Big Cat' in the world, after the          ferocious tiger. A fully-grown male tiger reaches a length of 1.7 m to          2.5 m (head and body), with its tail being somewhere around 70 to 105 cm          long. The tail of an Indian Lion has a dark tuft of fur at the end. Its          shoulder height is around 1 to 1.23 m and the animal weighs between 150          kg and 250 kg. A lioness is smaller in size as compared to the male and          reaches a height of 80 to 107 cm. The length of the head and the body is          1.7 to 2.5 m, while the weight is 120 to 180 kg.<br />
<br />
The males are orange-yellow to dark brown in color, while the females          have a sandy or tawny color. Males also have a mane, which is usually          dark in color, but is rarely seen to be of black color. This          characteristic mane is absent in the females. The mane of an Asiatic          Lion is also shorter than that of an African Lion. However, Indian Lions          are much more bushy, with longer tufts of hair at the end of the tail as          well as on the elbow joints, than their African cousins. <br />
<br />
<strong>Behavior</strong><br />
<img src="maincontent_asiatic-lion.jpg" alt="Asiatic Lion" align="right" width="205" height="155" /> Indian Lions are the only Big Cats that are seen living in large          groups, known as 'prides'. A typical pride comprises of around 15          members, which includes related lionesses, their cubs and a few males.          The number of males in a pride is usually around three and one of them          dominates the rest of the group, including the other males. In a pride,          it is the lionesses that do all the work, right from taking care of the          cubs to hunting. The males only make the first claim on the game hunted          by the female. <br />
<br />
The lionesses as well as the cubs eat only the leftovers. Male lions          establish their pride's territorial boundaries by roaring and scent          marking and fiercely defend it. All the members of the pride are closely          attached with one another. Infact, majority of the lionesses remain with          a particular pride throughout their life. However, a male is expelled          from the pride the moment it is 3 years old. The few male lions that do          not join any group become a major threat to the ones with a pride.          Asiatic lions usually hunt in groups and are rarely seen stalking a prey          in isolation. <br />
<br />
<strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
Male lions attain the age of maturity around 5 years of age, while the          lionesses become mature after becoming 4 years old. There is no          particular mating season of the Indian Lions. They can mate anytime          during the entire year. The gestation period lasts for 100 to 119 days,          after which 3 to 4 cubs are born. <br />
<br />
<strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
Asiatic Lions are found inhabiting open grasslands and forests of          India, including scrub jungles. <br />
<br />
<strong>Diet</strong><br />
Indian Lions are carnivorous and depend upon hunting for food. Their          prey mainly comprises of Deer, Antelope, Wild Boar and Wild Buffalo. At          times, lions have also been observed attacking young hippopotamus and          elephants. <br />
<br />
<strong>Geographical Range</strong><br />
Asiatic Lions are highly endangered species and have become extinct          from all the countries of the world, except the Indian subcontinent. In          India also, the animal is found only in the Gir forests of Gujarat. <br />
<br />
<strong>Current Status</strong><br />
The last census on the Asiatic Lions was carried out in the year 2006.          It revealed the population of the species to be somewhere around 359,          including over 50 lions kept in captivity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Trivia</strong><br />
Asiatic lions form prides (groups), in which all the work, including          hunting, is done by the lionesses. The only work that males do is to          make the first claim on the prey hunted by the females. Apart from that,          they just laze around and do nothing. </div>

      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
      The first effort in respect of Asiatic (Indian) lion          breeding program was made as far back as the 1960s. Attempts were made          at inter-zoo co-operative breeding. For the purpose, studbooks were          organized for the first time to trace out the origin and history of the          captive individuals. Thereafter, in the 1970s, breeding program for          Asiatic Lions was made more organized as well as controlled. In the year          1981, American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) started the Species          Survival Program (SSP), a breeding program for the Indian lions.<br />
    <br />
    The Species Survival Program aimed at handling animals of the same          species, lodged at different zoos as a single populace. The genetic and          demographic data about the entire population was collected and organized          into a studbook. The decisions regarding which animals should breed and          with whom were to be taken on the basis of the studbook. On the same          basis, it was to be decided whether a particular animal should be          removed from the breeding recommendation or from the program itself. <br />
  <br />
    The program started with the management of over 200 Indian lion          descendants, which were kept in western zoos. The studbook as well as          the management plan was established with a retrospective effect. The          entire captive population of Asiatic lion outside India came from only          seven founder lions, which were traced to be native to India. The small          number of founder lions led to the dangers of inbreeding and the          exposure of harmful recessive traits. At the same time, a report by S.J.          O'Brien revealed that majority of the captive population was not purely          Asiatic also.<br />
  <br />
    The result of the above-mentioned complications was the discontinuance          of the Species Survival Program. In the year 1990, European Breeding          Program (EEP) was founded. London Zoo imported four purely Asiatic lions          (2 males, 2 females) from India. Thereafter, zoos situated in Zurich and          Helsinki also received Asiatic lions in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The          program was formalized in 1994, with the established of a new studbook.          By the end of 1996, the membership of the Asiatic lion EEP had increased          to twelve.

  Asiatic Lion is facing a major threat to its survival          not in India only, but the whole world. Initially the population of the          Asiatic Lion was distributed from Caucasus to Yemen and from Macedon to          present-day India, through Iran (Persia). However, today, the natural          habitat of the majestic animal has become restricted to the Gir National          Park of India only. The threat to the Asiatic Lion was recognized in          India a long time back and conservations efforts for the same were          started as far back as the year 1910. <br />
  <br />
The first authority to initiate conservation efforts in relation to          Indian Lion was the Nawab of Junagadh. He banned the hunting of the          lions within his province. Even after the country gained independence in          the year 1947, the ban continued to be in force. In the decades of 1960s          and 1970s, the Gir was declared as a sanctuary and national park          respectively. Some time back, the Kuno Project was undertaken in the          Indian subcontinent as a part of the conservation efforts for the          Asiatic Lion. <br />
<br />
Under the Kuno Project, a wildlife sanctuary, known as the Kuno          Wildlife Sanctuary, is being developed to create a near natural habitat          for the lions. The aim behind the establishment of the sanctuary is to          relocate the excess population of the lions in Gir. However, the          sanctuary is still not fully complete and many steps are required to be          undertaken to create that perfect habitat for the royal animal. Experts          are conducting research on a regular basis to find a solution to the          problem of declining population of the Asiatic Lions in India.<br />
<br />
One of the main threats to the Asiatic Lion comes from the increasing          hostility on the part of the resident human population of Gir. Human          beings have become one of the major reasons contributing to a dip in the          population of the Indian Lions. It is required that the population of          Maldharis and other villagers living inside the protected area of the          Gir National Park be sensitized about the importance of conserving          lions. They should be involved in the conservation activities being          carried on within the protected area. <br />
<br />
Including the local residents within the field staff of the Gir Forest          Department can also prove to be quite beneficial. One of the basic          reasons for the conflict between humans and lions is that the lions          attack the livestock of the villagers. Though there is a system of          compensating villagers for the loss of the livestock, there is a need to          make it simpler as well as more equitable. Another option is to relocate          the human population living inside the park to new locations.          Consolidation as well as expansion of the park boundaries can also be          considered. <br />
<br />
The afforestation programs in grasslands and savannah areas of the Gir          forest should be avoided as far as possible. At the same time, the          habitat of the lions should be improved. One of the ways of ensuring          this is by thinning of the teak stands, which will lead to the opening          up of the forest canopy. The government can also include adjoining          Chachai-Pania sanctuary within the protected area of Gir National Park.          Steps should also be taken to reduce the traffic inside the Gir National          Park. Once these steps are followed, the situation is expected to          improve drastically.</div>
      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">In the past, the natural habitat of the Asiatic Lion          stretched from northern Greece, across Southwest Asia, to central India.          However, slowly and gradually, the species became extinct from all the          countries of the world, except India. In the Eastern Europe, Asiatic          lions became extinct around 100 AD, while in Palestine, the species          disappeared around the time of the Crusades. Asiatic Lions continued to          roam the other countries till the mid 1800s. Around this time, firearms          were introduced and became one of the primary reasons for the declining          trend in the population of the lions. <br />
        <br />
People started hunting the animal on a large scale, which gradually led          to their total extinction from most of the countries. The species became          extinct in Turkey around the late 1800s. Even in Iran and Iraq, Asiatic          Lions were last sighted in the year 1942 and 1918 respectively. By this          time, the population of the majestic animal had dropped to alarming          proportions in India also. By the turn of the century, Asiatic Lions          were limited to only the Gir forests of India. The population of Asiatic          Lions in India fell to only 13 lions in 1907.<br />
<br />
It was then that the Nawab of Junagadh gave lions complete protection          and banned their hunting within his province. The first census of lions          in Gir, by the Indian Government, was carried out in the year 1936 and          yielded a count of 234 animals. The next census was conducted in 1936,          based on identification of individual pugmarks, and revealed a total          population of 234 lions. The census was again carried out between 1968          and 1979, based on animal counts at live baits, and it estimated the          population of lion to be somewhere around 100. <br />
<br />
As per the census of 1990, there were 221 adults lions living in the          Gir Lion Reserve and around 30-40 lions were found inhabiting the          adjacent agricultural areas. The current status of the Asiatic Lions is          based on the 2006 census, which revealed a population of around 359          lions in the Gir National Park. The entire population is living within          an area of 1,412 sq km (558 square miles) inside the sanctuary. Though          the population of Asiatic lions in India has increased considerably          since 1907, much still needs to be done. </div>

        <div> Asiatic Lion, known scientifically as Panthera Leo          persica, is a subspecies of the lion found only in the Indian          subcontinent. Even in India, the natural habitat of Asiatic lions has          been restricted to Gir National Park of Gujarat, though the animal is          found in other national parks of the country also. The royal animal is          also known as the Indian Lion and has a population of somewhere around          350. Asiatic Lion has also been depicted on the National Emblem of           India. Given below are some fast facts on the Asiatic Lion. Read on to          get know interesting facts about Indian Lions.<br />

      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">Presently, Gir National Park is serving as the only          home of the Asiatic lions in the whole world. However, the situation          used to be different some years back. Indian lion once used to roam          around in Asia Minor and Arabia, from Persia to India. Even in the          Indian subcontinent, they used to be found in the northern areas of the          country as well as in the eastern areas, upto Bihar. In south, Naramada          River used to serve as the boundary for the Asiatic lions. Read on to          know more about Asiatic lion history in India.<br />
        <br />
The species got extinct from Bihar in 1840, Delhi in 1834, Bhavalpur in          1842, Eastern Vindhyas &amp; Bundelkhand in 1865, Central India &amp;          Rajasthan in 1870 and Western Aravallis in 1880. The history of Asiatic          (Indian) Lion in the country tells us that the last time an Asiatic lion          was found in the wild outside Saurashtra was in the year 1884. By the          end of the nineteenth century, the habitat of lions in India got limited          to Gir only. During that time, the count of Asiatic lions in Gir by the          Nawab of Junagadh revealed their number to be only twelve.<br />
<br />
The years from 1901 to 1905 were very hard for the Asiatic lions as          they struggled to survive the devastation caused by a severe famine.          During that time, the Nawab served as their savior, providing them with          adequate protection. Between the years 1904 to 1911, their numbers rose          to a considerable degree. However, the death of the Nawab reversed the          whole trend and 12 to 13 lions were being shot annually. In the year          1911, British Administration tried to control this unchecked shooting.          Still, when the count of lions was checked in 1913, it had come down to          somewhere around twenty. <br />
<br />
Thereafter, intense efforts were taken to control this dwindling          population. The first organized census on the lion population in Gir was          carried out in 1936. It revealed the number of lions to be around 287.          In September 1965, the forest Department earmarked an area of          approximately 1265.01 sq km in Gir as a sanctuary. As a result of          implementation of wildlife management and Gir Development Scheme, the          number of lions in Gir increased from 177 in 1968 to 359 in 2005.</div>
      <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
        <div> Asiatic Lions are facing an imminent danger of          extinction, if immediate steps are not taken to stop their habitat          destruction and poaching. Even today, the population of Asiatic lions in          the world is limited to the Gir forests of India. As a solution of the          problem of their deteriorating natural habitat, the Wildlife Institute          of India conducted a research to find the place that could serve as a          new home for them. After much exploration, it zeroed on the Kuno           Wildlife Sanctuary as the place where the lions of Gir could be          relocated. <br />
          <br />
          This project was given the name of Kuno Project and was based in Madhya          Pradesh. As per the conservation biologists, the introduction of lions          in the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary would lead to a distribution of their          population, which is presently concentrated only in Gir. This would make          the species less susceptible to poaching and at the same time, reduce          the overcrowding of Gir. The Kuno Lion Project of India is intended to          provide Asiatic lions with the same habitat, which they used to rule          once. <br />
  <br />
          Situated in the northwest of Madhya Pradesh, Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary          has been selected for the project because it resembles the natural          habitat of the lions to quite an extent. In the year 1981, an area of          approximately 344.686 sq km in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh was          set aside to be developed into a sanctuary. Today, this area comprises          of the Kuno Wildlife Division and has an additional 900 sq km as a          buffer area. <br />
  <br />
          The entire area of the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary can be divided into a          number of habitats, namely riparian habitat, savanna woodland, ravenous          habitat, plateau and evacuated agricultural fields. The sanctuary is          serving as home to tiger, leopard, wolf, wild dog, chital, samber,          chinkara, nilgai, blackbuck, four-horned antelopes, wild pig, etc. One          can also see a wide range of bird species here. As a precursor to the          relocation of the Asiatic lions, the sanctuary was made free of human          beings. Around 24 villages were rehabilitated from the sanctuary for the          purpose. <br />
  <br />
          To prevent any water scarcity in the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary,          waterholes, in the form of ponds and saucers, have been created. The          other efforts taken for developing the sanctuary include the education          of the people belonging to the neighborhood communities, in order to          make them aware of the effects of living with a mega carnivore like          lion. Even after so many preparations, a number of steps are still left          to be undertaken before the lions of Gir can be effectively relocated          here. </div>
