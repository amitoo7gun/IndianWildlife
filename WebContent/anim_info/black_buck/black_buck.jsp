        Indian black buck is also known by a number of other names like Kala          Hiran, Sasin, Iralai Maan and Krishna Jinka. The scientific name of the          black buck antelope is Antilope cervicapra and it natural habitat is the          Indian subcontinent. Grass forms the staple diet of the blackbucks.          However, they do eat pods, flowers and fruits as supplements. The          average lifespan of the Indian kala hiran is twelve years and at the          maximum, they live for sixteen years. Black bucks are hunted by dogs and          wolves.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>About the Indian Black Buck</strong><br />
        The male black bucks grow to a height of 32 inches and weigh somewhere          between 70 and 95 pounds. Their upper part is covered with either dark          brown or black fur. Chest, belly, inner sides of the legs, muzzle and          chin of the males have white fur. Even the eyes are surrounded with          white rings. Male black bucks have ringed horns that are up to 28 inches          in length and twirl with three to four turns. When the male blackbucks          are born, they are light brown in color and as they reach the age of          three, they turn dark brown or black.<br />
  <br />
  <img src="black_buck_indian-black-buck.jpg" alt="Indian Black Buck" align="right" height="155" width="205" /> Female black bucks are much smaller than their male counterparts. They          are beige or light brown in color and most of the female blackbucks do          not even have horns. Even the few females that have horns lack the rings          and spirals that characterize the male horns. Black bucks have very          sharp eyesight, which, along with their great speed, forms their main          defense against the predators. Female black buck antelopes have a          gestation period of approximately five months. They generally give birth          to two fawns every year, at a gap of six months.<br />
  <br />
        The fawn of black buck spends the first two weeks after his birth in          the grass, between nursing. Only after completing the first two weeks          does the fawn join the group. Indian black bucks seldom live in          isolation, they are found mainly in groups. The groups can be either          those of the females, comprising of 15 to 20 members, mixed groups,          bachelor groups or territorial males. The group of territorial males          dominates all the other groups and inhabits the main grazing areas,          along with the female groups. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat </strong><br />
        Apart from India, black buck is found in parts of Pakistan and Nepal.          Initially in India, the blackbucks were found almost everywhere except          for the northeastern regions. However, today the population of black          bucks has become limited to parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and          Gujarat, along with a few areas in the Central India. Blackbucks have          open plains of India as their natural habitat and count amongst the          fastest running animals on earth. <br />
  <br />
        They live on open grasslands, dry thorn and scrublands. Black bucks          were introduced in various parts of the world, including a number of          ranches in Texas, in the United States of America. There are also          free-ranging populations of Indian black bucks in Argentina (Pampas in          southern Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Entre Ríos provinces).<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Current status of Black Bucks</strong><br />
        Black bucks are included in the list of endangered species in India as          well as Nepal. Two major factors that have contributed to their          declining population are poaching and habitat destruction. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Threats </strong><br />
        Apart from poaching and habitat destruction, the other threats to          blackbucks include predation, overgrazing, diseases, inbreeding and          hoards of visitors. The flesh and skin of black buck fetches quite a          high price in the market, making the animal extremely vulnerable to          hunting. The species is suffering from inbreeding and at the same time,          there is the wide scale encroachment by the humans. Once found easily in          the plains of North India, they have now being restricted to a few          pockets in the country.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Trivia</strong><br />
        Bollywood actor Salman Khan was convicted for killing a black buck,          while shooting for the film 'Hum Saath Saath Hain'. However, the          conviction was stayed some time later. </div>

    <div> Apart from India, the only other countries where the          black buck is found are those of Pakistan and Nepal. Known by the name          of Kala Hiran in the Indian subcontinent, black buck is one of the          fastest running animals on this earth. The male black buck is dark brown          or black in color, while the color of female black buck is light brown.          Most of the female black bucks do not have horns. In case they do have          horns, they are not spiraled like that of the males. There are many more          interesting facts about the blackbuck.
