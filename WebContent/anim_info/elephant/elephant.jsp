      <div>Indian          elephant, known with the scientific name of 'Elephas maximus indicus',          is a subspecies of the Asian Elephant. It is mainly found in the Indian          subcontinent, that to in the scrub forested areas. The other counties          where Asian elephants are found include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Borneo,          Cambodia, China, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, Sumatra, and          Vietnam. Since Indian elephants are very huge and can trample all other          creatures, they have no natural enemies. Even lions, hyenas, and tigers          attack only the very young elephants and not adults.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Physical Traits </strong><br />
        Asian elephants of the Indian subcontinent grow to a height of between          8 ft and 10 ft. Slightly smaller than the African elephant, they weigh          as much as 7,000 to 11000 pounds. The feet of an Asian elephant are very          large and broad, which enables it to balance its enormous weight quite          easily. There are thick soles below the feet, which absorb shock and          cushion legs, when the elephant walks and runs. Their length varies          between 216 inches and 252 inches. <br />

These tusks are actually incisor teeth made up of          ivory, which may grow upto 5 ft in length. The tusks are used by the          elephants in digging for food, clearing debris, and carrying logs. The          only other animal that has ivory tusks is the walrus. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Natural Habitat</strong><br />
        Though Indian elephants are found everywhere, they prefer the scrub          forests of India, with abundant food supply and shady areas. They do not          stay at a particular place for more than a couple of days. One of the          reasons for this is that their diet is very huge and they have to move          to new areas to keep them supplied with food all the times. At times,          you find Asian elephants roaming around in the Indian jungles. However,          this is possible only if there is a there's a meadow or open space (with          grass) around. They also prefer muddy areas in summers, where they can          cool off during the hot daytime.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Diet</strong><br />
        Asian Elephant is herbivorous and survives on bamboo, berries, mangoes,          bananas, shrubs, tree foliage, wood, apples, wild rice and coconuts.          Only half of the food eaten by elephants is used by their body.          Therefore, it is necessary for them to eat 330 and 350 pounds of food          every day. Their diet also consists of approximately 22 to 30 gallons of          water per day.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Behavior </strong><br />
        The groups (herds) of elephants are matriarchal i.e., a female elephant          leads the herd. Males remain isolated and rarely form groups. They          usually join the herd only when the mating season approaches. The          members of a herd make use of a number of gestures and sounds while          communicating with each other. Their sense of commitment towards the          other members of the group is very strong. A female elephant protects          her young one very fiercely. In her absence, this responsibility comes          in the hands of the other females of the herd.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mating Behavior</strong><br />
        Male elephants fight to establish rights over a female herd. Indian          elephants reach maturity by the age of twelve. The gestation period is          between 630 and 660 days and the number of offspring is only one. The          baby elephant is known as calf and usually weighs between 200 and 250          pounds.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Senses</strong><br />
        Indian elephants are highly intelligent creatures and have acute senses          of hearing and smell. They have large ears and can hear even those          sounds that other animals do not. However, elephants have poor vision          and their small eyes can see only upto 60 ft. Even though they are huge,          elephants can easily balance their weight on two legs, especially while          reaching the leaves of a tree. Even their sense of smell and sense of          taste is very delicate.<br />
